since this package binds keys to CTRL+&lt;number&gt;, it overrides Mudlet's default behavior of jumping to a particular tab. As this package is designed to run along side [ChannelHistory](https://github.com/ironcross32/ChannelHistory), which uses Alt+&lt;number&gt; for its most recent history per category, these keybindings cannot change. Thus, for those wishing to use these two packages in tandem, while preserving the ability to jump between multiple profiles, it will be necessary to change the following option within the, ""Special Options"" tab in preferences:
* Switch between input line and main window using:
F6 is recommended for users who wish to retain their ability to use tab auto-completion, however, tab may be a good choice for those who do not use it."

The examples in the [wiki](https://demonnic.github.io/mdk/current/) are written with this in mind, and you would require the items you need as `local EMCO = require(""MDK.emco"")`
