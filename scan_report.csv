## Installation"
figinator.mpackage,config.lua,16,External Communications,https://,"The fastest way to install the figinator is to run the following alias:

`lua uninstallPackage(""figinator"") installPackage(""https://github.com/demonnic/figinator/releases/latest/download/figinator.mpackage"")`

After that you can stay up to date using the `fig update` alias. (Available in 1.2+)"
figinator.mpackage,config.lua,95,External Communications,https://,"## Credit and acclaim

The figlet lua implementation is primarily the work of Nick Gammon and was taken from [his forum](https://www.gammon.com.au/forum/?id=10748&reply=6#reply6) then modified to be a lua module. And I added some convenience methods for getting strings directly instead of a table of lines.

Then I took that and wrapped it in this package which includes several fonts pulled from [this git repo](https://github.com/xero/figlet-fonts) and some convenience methods for switching between the included ones easily."

In short, all the coolest parts of what this does are things other people made, I'm just trying to make them easy for Mudlet users to use =)"
