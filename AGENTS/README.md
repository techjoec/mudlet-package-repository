# AGENTS Bootstrap Guidance

This folder mirrors the structure from [techjoec/AGENTS](https://github.com/techjoec/AGENTS).
It contains notes for other AGENTS sessions so that knowledge gained in one
session can be shared with others.

Key practices:

- Always sync the latest contents of `techjoec/AGENTS` before starting work.
- Make edits to these docs as you learn new things about the project.
- Another session will eventually merge changes back to the upstream AGENTS repo.
- Check this folder first when starting a session for project hints or
  special instructions.

Directory layout:

```
/AGENTS
  README.md                  # this guide
  /environments/             # repo-specific docs
  /shared/                   # notes shared across projects (optional)
  /chatgt/                   # ChatGPT-only info if required
```

Each repository should have its own folder under `environments/`. For this
repository the folder is `environments/mudlet-package-repository/`.
Place any lessons learned, TODOs or scanning results there so future sessions can
quickly get up to speed without repeating mistakes.
