# Mudlet Package Repository Notes

This folder stores tips and findings specific to the Mudlet package scanning
project. When you scan packages or tweak detection logic, jot down anything that
might help the next session here.

Guidelines:

- Follow `AGENTS.md` in the repository root for scanner usage.
- Keep `scan_report.html` up to date when detection rules change.
- Record unusual packages or patterns so others know what to watch for.
- Use `userinputs/` (create if needed) for any large logs or sample files
  provided by the project owner. Track their status in an accompanying
  `AGENTS.md` so we know when data can be archived or removed.
